### Standard workflow (Recommended)

1. Preparing Model Weights 

    Download the file to the specified folder using the command below. For additional download links, visit [doc](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanDiT?tab=readme-ov-file#-download-pretrained-models). 
    ```shell
    # (Optional) download pretrain-weight
    huggingface-cli download Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2 --local-dir ${HunyuanDiT}/ckpts
    # clip
    ln -s ${HunyuanDiT}/ckpts/t2i/clip_text_encoder/pytorch_model.bin ${ComfyUI}/models/clip/pytorch_model.bin
    # mt5
    mkdir ${ComfyUI}/models/t5
    ln -s ${HunyuanDiT}/ckpts/t2i/mt5/pytorch_model.bin ${ComfyUI}/models/t5/pytorch_model.bin
    # vae
    ln -s ${HunyuanDiT}/ckpts/t2i/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin ${ComfyUI}/models/vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin
    # base model
    huggingface-cli download Tencent-Hunyuan/Distillation-v1.2 pytorch_model_distill.pt --local-dir ${ComfyUI}/models/checkpoints/
    ```
    Put module weights trained through Kohya or the official script in `${ComfyUI}/models/checkpoints/` to switch model weights in ComfyUI.

2. Preparing LoRa Weights

    ```shell
    # Put LoRa weights trained by Kohya in ComfyUI/models/loras
    cp ${HunyuanDiT}/kohya_ss/outputs/last-step{xxxx}.safetensors ${ComfyUI}/models/loras
    
    # (Optional) Put LoRa weights trained by official scripts in ComfyUI/models/loras
    python custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit/convert_hunyuan_to_comfyui_lora.py \
          --lora_path ${HunyuanDiT}/log_EXP/001-lora_porcelain_ema_rank64/checkpoints/0000100.pt/adapter_model.safetensors \
          --save_lora_path ${ComfyUI}/models/loras/adapter_model_convert.safetensors
    
    # update the `lora.py` file

    ```shell
    # Put LoRa weights trained by Kohya in ComfyUI/models/loras
    cp ${HunyuanDiT}/kohya_ss/outputs/adapter_model.safetensors ${ComfyUI}/models/loras
    
    # (Optional) Put LoRa weights trained by official scripts in ComfyUI/models/loras
    # The PEFT diffuser format needs to be converted into the standard ComfyUI format
    python custom_nodes/comfyui-hydit/convert_hunyuan_to_comfyui_lora.py \
          --lora_path ${HunyuanDiT}/log_EXP/001-lora_porcelain_ema_rank64/checkpoints/0000100.pt/adapter_model.safetensors \
          --save_lora_path ${ComfyUI}/models/loras/adapter_model_convert.safetensors
    
    # update the `lora.py` file
